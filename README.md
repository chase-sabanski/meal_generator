# meal_plan_generator

I got tired of thinking of meals when going through baby-led weaning so I created this python script. It will generate a 30 day meal plan based on 4 categories: proteins, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables.

You can add or remove items from the categories to fit your baby's need.

# TODO:
- Scramble the 4 categories when the lists exceed 30 length. This allows for more variety and a chance for all ingredients to be used (eventually).
