# meal_generator

I got tired of thinking of meals when going through baby-led weaning so I created this python script. It will generate a 30 day meal plan based on 4 categories: proteins, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables.

You can add or remove items from the categories to fit your need.

# TODO:
- Create a shopping list based on the ingredients needed for 4 consecutive meals
